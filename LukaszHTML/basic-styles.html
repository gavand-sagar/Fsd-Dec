    Gurl.com was a US website for teenage girls that was online 
    from 1996 to 2018. It was created by 
    <span style="color:orange;font-size: 30px;">Rebecca Odes</span>, 
    <br>Esther Drill, and Heather McDonald as a resource centered on teen advice, body image, 
    sexuality, and other teen concerns.</p>

    <p style="background-color:blueviolet;color:azure;font-size:25px">Gurl.com attracted privacy concerns, and criticism from conservative and anti-pornography advocates for its sex-positive stance and sex education resources.</p>
