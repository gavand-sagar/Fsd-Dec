<p><b>Nadezhda Sergeyevna Alliluyeva[a]</b></p>
 <p>Russian: Надежда Сергеевна Аллилуева; 22 September [O.S. 9 September] 1901 – 9 November 1932) 
    was the second wife of Joseph Stalin.
</p>
<p>She was born in Baku to a friend of Stalin, 
    a fellow revolutionary, and was raised in Saint Petersburg. Having known Stalin from a
     young age, she married him when she was 18, and they had two children. Alliluyeva worked as
      a secretary for Bolshevik leaders, including Vladimir Lenin and Stalin, before enrolling at 
      the Industrial Academy in Moscow to study synthetic fibres and become an engineer.
</p>
<p>
      She had health issues, which had an adverse impact on her relationship with Stalin.
       She also suspected he was unfaithful, which led to frequent arguments with him.
</p>
<p>
       On several occasions, Alliluyeva reportedly contemplated leaving Stalin,
and after an argument fatally shot herself early in the morning of 9 November 1932.
